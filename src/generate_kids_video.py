"""
generate_kids_video.py
Builds the 2D cutout-animation video for kids channels (e.g. Jungle Ke
Dost): a set of mascot pose frames (from generate_mascot_assets.py) +
narrated audio + word-timing JSON (from tts.py) -> a video that cuts
between poses on phrase boundaries, so the mascot waves/claps/jumps/dances
along instead of sitting there flapping its mouth.

APPROACH: rather than alpha-overlaying two pixel-aligned frames (the old
mouth-flap system), this concatenates short, independent clips -- one per
pose-hold segment. Because poses are now independently generated images
(no shared base to stay aligned with, see generate_mascot_assets.py's
docstring), a straight cut between them is not just simpler, it's the
correct approach -- trying to alpha-blend unrelated images would look
worse, not better. Discrete pose-swaps are also just how real simple 2D
"cutout style" channels look.

Deliberately reuses assemble_video.py's duration/caption helpers instead
of reimplementing them -- same captions, same libass/HarfBuzz fix for
Hindi text shaping, one place to maintain that logic.

Pose timeline: phrase (caption chunk) boundaries drive pose changes --
"idle" fills silence/gaps between chunks, "talk" is the default while a
chunk is being narrated, and every ACTION_POSE_EVERY-th chunk gets a fun
action pose instead of plain talk, cycling through ACTION_POSES for
variety/rhythm.
